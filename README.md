# hashblock-exchange
First generation blockchain applications use UTXO transactions to record the value of a single resource that is minted and transferred between blockchain addresses. Bitcoin is an example of a first generation blockchain.

Second generation blockchain applications use single-resource smart-contracts to record the value of a resource that is minted and transferred between blockchain addresses. The ICO (initial coin offering) smart contract is an example of a second generation blockchain application.

Third generation blockchains use multi-resource smart-contracts to record the multi-dimensional and multi-scale values of multiple resources that are minted and exchanged between blockchain addresses. The hashblock-exchange resource, unit, and match family of smart contracts are an example of a third generation blockchain application.

The limitations of transfer-of-value smart contracts are exemplified by the fact that cryptocurrency brokerages do not use a blockchain to record the exchange of value when fiat currency is exchanged for cryptocurrency or visa-versa. A blockchain is used to record the transfer of value when units of a single resource are transferred between accounts. The cash receipt you get from a cash register is an example of a multi-resource value exchange because the receipt registers the quantity or product and the quantity of cash that is exchanged between two parties.

Hashblock-exchange overcomes these limitation with multiple smart contract transaction families. 

* The first three are the resource, unit, and match smart contract transaction families. The resource transaction family is used to propose the vote resources, for example peanuts and USD, on and off the chain. 
* The unit transaction family is used to propose and vote resource units, for example, bag and $, on and off the chain. 
* The match transaction family is uses Unmatched Transaction Quantity (UTXQ) and Matched Transaction Quantity (MTXQ) transactions to record the dual initiating and reciprocating events that comprise a value exchange. An exchange could be potential as in an ask/tell duality, or contractual as in an offer/accept duality, or operational as in a commitment/obligation duality, or actual as in a give/take duality.  The match transaction family also validates that initiating events are not double matched and that the value of exchange resources balances. In contract to a value-transfer balancing equation, input-value=output-value, a value-exchange balancing equation requires a ration, unmatched-quantity * ratio = matched-quantity. Hasblock uses a Godel Hash encoding of units and resources so that balancing equations like 5.bags{peanuts} * $2{USD}/1.bag{peanuts} = $10{USD} can be validated algebraically.
